# Reinventing the wheel while fighting bot dection

Last week a friend of mine planted (without noticing) a doubt in my brain that got me hooked to study and learn! Essentially when you're automating a web tsak (like going to site www.example.com, log in, enter a query, submit it, and click on the first results) 

I never learn, I always start by reinventing the wheel then I got bored and search for what I'm building and ðŸ’¡ someone did that 1000x better than me ðŸ¤¡!

```mermaid
graph TD;
    step1([Stumble upon a problem X])-->step2[Think about X];
    step2-->step2;
    
    subgraph fun_loop
    step2-->step3(Magnify many possible sub problems to X)
    step3-->step2;
    step3-->step4[[Write some code to tackle a sub problem of X]]
    step4-->step5(Get excited)
    step5-->step3;
    end
    
    step5-->step6[[Realize someone probably won this batle already :clown:]]
    
    subgraph wisdom_moment
    step6-- Search on -->step7[(Internet)]
    step7-- There's a 1000x better solution available :clown: -->step6
    end
    
```
